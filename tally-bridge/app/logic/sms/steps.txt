Here are some additional steps you may need to take in order to create a basic React Native app with the above functionality:

Install React Native and its dependencies: You'll need to have Node.js, the React Native command line tools, and a development environment set up on your machine in order to start building a React Native app.

Create a new React Native project: Use the react-native init command to create a new project, which will generate the basic file structure for your app.

Install the react-native-android-sms-listener package: You can use npm or yarn to install the package in your app.

Add the necessary permissions to the AndroidManifest.xml file: The package needs the READ_SMS permission to function, you need to add the following line in your AndroidManifest.xml file:

Copy code
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
Add the code to your App.js file: You can add the code that I have provided in the previous answer, to your App.js file or any other component you wish to handle the SMS functionality

Test your app: You can use an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device to your machine to test the app. Make sure that you have the development environment set up correctly and that your device is connected and recognized by your development environment.

Build and Deploy: You can use the react-native run-android command to build and deploy the app to your device or emulator.

Secure your Server: Make sure that you have a secure server endpoint to handle the SMS data sent to it, you can use HTTPS and authentication to secure the connection.
